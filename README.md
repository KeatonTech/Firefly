# Firefly
A new way to lecture

Firefly aims to shift the paradigm of powerpoint slide decks towards a more interactive and engaging experience in the classroom.  To aid learning and create a more enriching learning environment, presentations should be two-way communications between the students and the professor.  Firefly will allow students to submit content or questions to the presenter to have displayed on screen, right from a mobile web application.
